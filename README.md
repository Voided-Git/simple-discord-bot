# Simple Discord Bot #
A simple Discord bot built using [PyCord](https://pycord.dev)'s Discord API wrapper for general purposes that a Discord server may need while still having some commands for a community's sake.

## Known Issues ##
- Timeout command doesn't work : the library has the wrong permission specified
- `logging_setup` and `tickets_setup` don't work due to a type error

## Todo ##
- [ ] Add configurability for enabling or disabling commands / features
- [ ] Add more logging
- [ ] Add old style error handling (SDTB)
- [ ] Add docs / wiki
